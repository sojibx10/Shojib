## How to Use These Platforms

### Replit
Replit is an online coding environment that lets you write, run, and test code directly from your browser without any setup.  
Simply sign up for a free account, create a new project (called a “Repl”), and start coding in languages like JavaScript, Python, C++, and many more.  
It’s perfect for quick prototyping, learning programming, or collaborating with others in real-time.  
You can also host simple web apps and share your projects with a public URL instantly.  

### Render
Render is a cloud hosting platform that allows you to deploy websites, APIs, and applications easily without worrying about server management.  
After developing your app locally or on Replit, you can push your code to Render for continuous deployment.  
It supports popular frameworks, automatic SSL, custom domains, and background workers.  
This platform is ideal for developers who want hassle-free hosting with scalable resources.  

### GitHub
GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaborative code management using Git.  
It lets you store your code repositories securely, track changes, and collaborate with other developers through pull requests and issues.  
GitHub also supports project documentation via README files and wikis, and it integrates with many CI/CD tools to automate workflows.  
Use GitHub to manage your projects efficiently and share your code with the developer community.
